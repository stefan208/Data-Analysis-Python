# Financial Data Analysis

This project demonstrates how I analyzed financial and operational KPI data using Python.  

### What I did
- Loaded financial and operational KPI data from Excel files  
- Cleaned, validated, and standardized the datasets (dates, missing values, duplicates)  
- Merged the datasets by date for consistent time-series analysis  
- Calculated key performance metrics:
  - Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)  
  - Year-over-Year (YoY) growth  
- Created a simple revenue trend visualization  

### How I did it
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, pathlib)** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  
- **Excel** as the source of KPI data  
- Ensured accuracy by validating key fields (dates, revenue) before analysis
